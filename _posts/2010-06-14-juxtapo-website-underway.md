The new Juxtapo website is now at juxtapo.net but I'm just doing some testing and continuing to add to the documentation and help.

The video is a bit naff as I recorded it in a busy room when the project was only at version 0.4. The setup is essentially the same so I'll leave it there for the moment.

I've also got plans to include a config builder on the site and more examples for using Juxtapo along with automated testing, Google Spreadsheets and other undocumented features.

I would really value any thoughts and information if any of the articles aren't clear or you're struggling to get Juxtapo up and running.

Thanks for now

Dave
