In here you will find documentation about how to use Juxtapo and also an API reference for developers who want to build plugins which interface with Juxtapo.

A good place to start is the [installation and setup page](installation.html) which will take you through the few steps needed to get up and running.

If you have any suggestions or areas that we haven't covered please leave a comment below.
