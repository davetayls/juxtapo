				Juxtapo started out as a simple design viewer which automatically refreshed the
				page every few seconds. I would set up 4 different browsers on my screens so that
				I could see pretty quickly how the changes I was making were affecting the layouts.
			</p>
			<p>
				Since then I have found working from within my development environment (the browser) 
				has sped up the development process and
				made it so much less painful. Now being able to browse across a set of designs
				and compare them, toggling between them side by side with the current state of
				the developed html/css.
			</p>
			<p>
				Juxtapo is still quite a baby product but I hope it makes your development experience
				a little smoother as it has mine. I'd love to hear from you about any feature suggestions
				or innovative ways you are using it.
